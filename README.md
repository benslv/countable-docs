ðŸ¤– Countable is a small, robust bot to help support and manage a counting channel in your Discord server!

## Getting Started

Setup is extremely easy, and only requires a couple of commands to get everything up and running!

1. Invite the bot to your server with [this link](https://invite.countable.cc).
2. Get Countable to watch your counting channel with [```set-channel``](commands.md#set-channel)
3. The count will start at 0, but you can use [```set-count``](commands.md#set-count) if you want to continue from an existing counting channel.

Happy counting!
